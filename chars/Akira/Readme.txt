=====<Move Details>=====

 - Tsutenda launches the opponent and can be canceled into Super Jump.
 - Upon canceling Tsutenda into Super Jump, the juggle count resets and you get access to Chain Combos in your Air Normals.
 - Kutenshu hits overhead.
 - Hotenshu has airborne strike invincibility on startup. EX Hotenshu has full body invincibility on startup.
 - The second hit of HP Senshubu launches for a juggle reset.
 - EX Senshubu launches for a juggle reset.
 - MAX Go Kiko Kai wall bounces for a juggle reset.

=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Command, Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage

CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
